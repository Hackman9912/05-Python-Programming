6. File Analysis
Write a program that reads the contents of two text files and compares them in the following ways:
• It should display a list of all the unique words contained in both files.
• It should display a list of the words that appear in both files.
• It should display a list of the words that appear in the first file but not the second.
• It should display a list of the words that appear in the second file but not the first.
• It should display a list of the words that appear in either the first or second file but not both.
Hint: Use set operations to perform these analyses.
