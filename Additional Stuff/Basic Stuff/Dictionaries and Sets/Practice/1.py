'''
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room numbers of the rooms where the 
courses meet. The dictionary should have the following keyvalue pairs:

Course Number (key) Room Number (value)
CS101               3004
CS102               4501
CS103               6755
NT110               1244
CM241               1411

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the names of
the instructors that teach each course. The dictionary should have the following key-value
pairs:

Course Number (key) Instructor (value)
CS101               Haynes
CS102               Alvarado
CS103               Rich
NT110               Burke
CM241               Lee

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the meeting
times of each course. The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:

Course Number (key) Meeting Time (value)
CS101               8:00 a.m.
CS102               9:00 a.m.
CS103               10:00 a.m.
NT110               11:00 a.m.
CM241               1:00 p.m.

The program should let the user enter a course number, and then it should display the
course’s room number, instructor, and meeting time.
